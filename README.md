# Historical tables for Sequelize

Warning: this is a fork of [sequelize-temporal](https://github.com/bonaval/sequelize-temporal) that adds support for Sequelize 5.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/opencollective/sequelize-historical.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/opencollective/sequelize-historical) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/opencollective/sequelize-historical.svg)](https://david-dm.org/opencollective/sequelize-historical) [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/sequelize-historical.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize-historical) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/opencollective/sequelize-historical.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

## What is it?

Historical tables maintain **historical versions** of data. Modifying operations (UPDATE, DELETE) on these tables don't cause permanent changes to entries, but create new versions of them. Hence this might be used to:

- log changes (security/auditing)
- undo functionalities
- track interactions (customer support)

Under the hood a history table with the same structure, but without constraints is created.

The normal singular/plural naming scheme in Sequelize is used:

- model name: `modelName + History`
- table name: `modelName + Histories`

## Installation

```
npm install sequelize-historical
```

## How to use

### 1) Import `sequelize-historical`

```
var Sequelize = require('sequelize');
var Historical = require('sequelize-historical');
```

Create a sequelize instance and your models, e.g.

```
var sequelize = new Sequelize('', '', '', {
	dialect: 'sqlite',
	storage: __dirname + '/.test.sqlite'
});
```

### 2) Add the _historical_ feature to your models

```
var User = Historical(sequelize.define('User'), sequelize);
```

The output of `historical` is its input model, so assigning it's output to your
Model is not necessary, hence it's just the lazy version of:

```
var User = sequelize.define('User', {.types.}, {.options.}); // Sequelize Docu
Historical(User, sequelize);
```

## Options

The default syntax for `Historical` is:

`Historical(model, sequelizeInstance, options)`

whereas the options are listed here (with default value).

```js
{
  /* runs the insert within the sequelize hook chain, disable
  for increased performance without warranties */
  blocking: true,
  /* By default sequelize-historical persist only changes, and saves the previous state in the history table.
  The "full" option saves all transactions into the historical database
  (i.e. this includes the latest state.)
   This allows to only query the hostory table to get the full history of an entity.
  */
  full: false
```

## Details

### History table

History table stores historical versions of rows, which are inserted by triggers on every modifying operation executed on current table. It has the same structure and indexes as current table, but it doesnâ€™t have any constraints. History tables are insert only and creator should prevent other users from executing updates or deletes by correct user rights settings. Otherwise the history can be violated.

### Hooks

Triggers for storing old versions of rows to history table are inspired by referential integrity triggers. They are fired for each row before UPDATE and DELETE (within the same transaction)

### Notes

If you only use Postgres, you might want to have a look at the [Temporal Table](https://github.com/arkhipov/temporal_tables) extension.
